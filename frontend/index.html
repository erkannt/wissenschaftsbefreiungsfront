<h1>Liberate Science</h1>
<br>
<h2>More than 2.000.000 academic publications<br>can be made freely accessible today.</h2>
<br>
<p style="font-size:130%">
Publishers that keep papers behind a paywall often allow re-publishing the paper freely accessible for everyone in the world. However, many authors don't know of this opportunity or don't leverage it.
<br><br>
Find out which of your papers you are allowed to re-publish today:

This project is built on the datasets and API available by https://unpaywall.org/ as well as the API at https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/api/ and is thereby dependent on the validity of the information collected at these services.
Note, that the information presented on liberate.science is not legal advice or a legal guarantee.
Specifically does it not relieve any author of the obligations originating from the contract(s) signed with respective publishers.
<br>
The number 2.000.000 in the header is a conservative estimate, determined via a data analysis pipeline that is publically available at https://github.com/erkannt/wissenschaftsbefreiungsfront
