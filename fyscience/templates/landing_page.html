				Why is this allowed?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Paying a journal to make your research publications open access is not the only way you can liberate
				your science from paywalls and expensive journal subscriptions.
				Many publishers actually allow publishing a freely accessible version of the paper, separate from the
				journal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Depending on the journal's policy, you can upload your work to an institutional archive (e.g. your
				university library), a preprint server like arXiv or your personal website.
				The policies usually distinguish between the <em>submitted</em>, <em>accepted</em> and
				<em>published</em> version of a document.
				Most often you are allowed to re-publish the <em>accepted</em> or <em>submitted</em> version, without
				having to pay the publisher.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most policies require you to link the freely accessible version back to the paywalled version.
				This helps to make sure that other publications end up citing the main version of the paper.
				At the same time, having a free copy available, more people are able to find your research.

				Free Your Science builds upon a set of wonderful existing services that try to make scientific works

				We heavily rely on their databases being correct and appreciate the service they offer to the world.

				Our Motivation
			</h2>
			{#
			- background:
			-- enjoy collaborative spirit of globally networked academic communities
			-- foster accessibility and collaboration
			-- can't stand when information that should be freely accessible is unnecessarily hidden behind paywalls
			- strategy:
			-- tbd
			- for authors:
			-- enable to discover the potential they have with past publications
			- for institutions:
			-- call us
			#}
			<p>
				We are two open science enthusiasts. Having worked in different positions of academia, from being an
				author to supporting institutions with grant writing and being part of the publisher side of things, we
				have come to appreciate the open and collaborative spirit of the academic community but also came to
				acknowledge the constraints that still restrict the accessibility of scientific results.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our goal is to foster accessibility and collaboration in the beautiful, globally networked academic
				communities.
				Also, we just can't stand when information that should be freely accessible is unnecessarily hidden
				behind paywalls.
			</p>
			<p>
				Accordingly, our strategy is to:
			<ul>
				<li>create awareness about the potential of publisher's Open Access policies</li>
				<li>help authors understand which research they can free from paywalls</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Looking forward, we hope that research institutions, funders and other interested parties can use this
				tool to discover the potential that they have to drastically increase the amount of Open Access
				publications.
