		<h2>What we provide for authors</h2>
		<p>Free Your Science is out to show authors like you which of your paywalled publications you can re-publish open access today and how to do it.</p>

		<h3>Find your paywalled publications</h3>
		<p>
			Publishers can keep your publications behind paywalls.
			This limits your scientific reach to readers with paid subscriptions.
			We help you to find these publications.
		</p>

		<h3>Identify open access pathways</h3>
		<p>
			Many publishers allow open access re-publication of your work, free of charge, today.
			Using a publisher policy database, we find the best pathway for your work to become open access.
		</p>

		<h3>Learn to re-publish open access</h3>
		<p>
			Depending on the identified pathway you can deposit your manuscript in places like arXiv or PubMed.
			Our About pages help you understand this process.
